## Pinbot
Pinbot is an attempt at combining the starboard feature and extending it with
Discord pinned messages - instead of reacting with a star emoji, you pin a
message to broadcast the message to the pinboard. You can have as many pinboards
as you want, while also allowing you to have as many pinned messages as you want
also.

### Features
- Extend pinned messages by migrating them over to a pinboard
- Link a channel to a pinboard, or link as many channels to as many pinboards as
  you want - the sky's your limit
- Migrate pinned messages to a pinboard
    - This can be handled for you automatically, with confirmation, or you can
      migrate them yourself using the `migrate` command - made as simple as
      possible for your server with your rules
    - Can't confirm the migration? That's fine, just get somebody that can
      manage messages to do it for you - delegation has never been easier

### How can I use this?
At the moment this bot is intended for use strictly in
[DuckBot](https://duck-bot.com/)'s server. If you would like to advocate for it
to be a public bot, feel free to let me know,
